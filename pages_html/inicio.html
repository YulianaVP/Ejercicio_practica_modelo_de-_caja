                    The Aurora is a spacecraft sent to the Ariadne Arm by the Alterra Corporation 
                    in order to build a phasegate. However, its secondary mission, unknown to most 
                    of the crew, was to search for and, possibly, rescue the survivors of the Degasi crew.

                During a gravity slingshot maneuver around Planet 4546B, the Aurora was struck by a mysterious energy pulse, resulting in catastrophic hull failure, leading to its crash landing on the surface of the planet. It is later revealed that it was the Quarantine Enforcement Platform that shot it down.

            <p class="awita">
                Many Lifepods were destroyed by the energy pulse and the ones that did launch were all compromised with the exception of two: Lifepod 5, which contained Ryley Robinson, and Lifepod 4, though its flotation devices seemingly failed or was possibly overturned by a Reaper Leviathan.

        The PDA reports the Aurora's state and information about the environment to the player as they survive. During exploration of the Aurora, it will explain the state of the ship around you.
